My name is Theotime Leveque.
I'm a Developer with an interest in large-scale architectures and a passion for European Handball.

I'm currently working at [Dailymotion][dailymotion] in NYC as a Core Engineer, designing and developing
payment microservices with a team of passionate and crazy devs.

I primarily work with Python and Go and spend a lot of time learning about SRE and high scalability solutions.

In my spare time, I like to look for new restaurants, travel, watch documentaries, play chess, go to meetups and work on various side projects.

I'm also an [Ironman][ironman] wannabe.
